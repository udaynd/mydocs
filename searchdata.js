							" Known Issues and Limitations The following table lists known issues and limitations associated with Libero SoC v12 6 Known Issues and Limitations Associated with Libero SoC v12 6 Family Description Libero All families For designs using CoreAHBLite combined region slot the SmartDesign Memory Map does not show the correct Range of the combined region slot The expected range of the combined region slot is n times the size of each slot where n is the number of slots assigned to the combined region slot However in the View Memory Map dialog the range for the combined region slot is shown as 0x0000_0000 resulting in a DRC IGLOO2 For a System Builder design that uses only FDDR out of the DDR/SERDES peripherals the exported Tcl description file shows the FABRIC_DDR_SETTLING_TIME is not set (the EXTMEM page is not configured) There is no issues if only MDDR is used or if FDDR is used in combination with MDDR in a design Workaround: If there's a requirement of a FABRIC_DDR_SETTLING_TIME other than its default value 200 manually update the exported Tcl description file to add the below lines after the Device Features page configuration # Configuring the Memories page of System Builder component sb_configure_page -component_name ${sysbld_name} -page_name {EXTMEM} -params {FABRIC_DDR_SETTLING_TIME: non_default_value } PolarFire Opening two or more views (for example Hierarchical RTL View and Flattened Post-Compile View) in Netlist Viewer may cause a crash due to memory usage Avoid opening multiple views for large designs The DRC check in the I/O Editor does not validate all the constraints set in the tool You must run Place and Route to validate these constraints   PolarFire  Using the protocol setting APMemory PSRAM of PF_IOD_OCTAL_DDR causes Place and Route to fail Workaround: Change to configuration to HyperBus with I0R0_RSTO_N enabled and I0R0_INT_N disabled The generated core will work properly with APMemory PSRAM    PolarFire PolarFire SoC   In Libero selecting Disable SNVM through Debug Policy on the Configure Security Wizard dialog box does not disable sNVM SmartDebug access  This affects PolarFire family in Libero v12 0 and later and PolarFire SoC family in Libero v12 5 and later   N/A If a module is present in an include file that is coming from a global include path but is not imported into the project the file is shown as linked file in the Design Hierarchy If the Global Include Path is broken (path is missing when opening a project) the include file also is shown with a broken link If the user tries to fix the broken global include path with a new path the broken file link with the old path still appears This does not affect functionality but an extra broken link is shown in the project Users must remove this link manually when changing the Global Include Path in Project Settings Synthesis PolarFire With Automatic Compile Point ON in Synthesis some designs with the CoreAXI4Interconnect IP might fail in derived constraints check in Place Route Workaround 1: In the Synthesis - Configure Options turn OFF the Automatic Compile Point and then run Synthesis Workaround 2: Use get_pins instead of

deprecated from SynplifyPro for RTG4 and PolarFire families All references to RAM Inference in ECC mode are removed from SynplifyPro documentation from Libero 12 5 onwards Replace any inferred ECC memory in your design for all IP cores with modules generated by the respective LSRAM Configurators  Timing/Power PolarFire The datasheet has slight variations of Max Frequency that software does not represent In particular the following two modes have a slightly lower Max Frequency: 18 × 19 multiplier pre-adder ROM mode Complex 18 × 19 multiplication The variations are small and on the high-end of the chip frequencies (between 455 and 470MHz at dash-one) PolarFire Starting with Libero SoC v12 4 SmartTime stopped propagating clocks when a generated clock is reached For example in a design the clocks are clk1 -- gen1 -- gen2 If gen2 is specified using gen1 as master there is no issue If gen2 is specified using clk1 as master however the generation fails as clk1 never reaches gen2 (it is stopped by gen1) Workaround: Specify the second generated clock using the first generated clock as master PolarFire In the SmartTime tool the search option using Apply filter is not working SmartDebug
